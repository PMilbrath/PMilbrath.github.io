                    Back in Highschool. I was more interested in Engineering than in computer science.
                    I joined our robotics team where I learned how to 3D design parts to make a model of the robot and help build it.
                    Teams from around the world made various robots for this competetion to complete that years goal.
                    When I first joined, it felt like chaos. However, it was an enjoyable chaos as we all communicated and
                    raced against the time limit to make and program our robot properly. It wasn't easy, and when we finished,
                    it was amazing watching our bot in the competetion, both cooperating and competing with various opponents.
                    FIRST is a huge community and without them, I may have never discovered my current passion in coding currently.

                        A couple years ago. I had an Internship at the Medical College of Wisconsin where I did two things.
                        One was set up an algorithm to organize and chart data in Microsoft Excel which was difficult because I
                        had to sort by two different variables and excel is very limited. However, the main thing I got to do was
                        beta test an app that was designed to test people for hearing loss. It was simple a simple test. You pressed
                        a button when you heard the beep at different pitches. Callibrating it was difficult because what worked for
                        an Iphone 5 wouldn't work with an Iphone 6 for example. I wish I could have stayed to work on it until we
                        got most of the bugs out (I could guess the amount of time inbetween beeps and have a "better than perfect" hearing.).
                        However, I had college to return to before we did.

                    Cyber Security was one of the roughest programming classes I had. Maybe because it was an online
                    class when I took it. However, it was a great experience to dive into.
                    In many of our projects in the class, we had to study security by breaking very bad homemade
                    versions from our teacher for many assignments. However, I loved reading articles about
                    security such as the problems with backdoors (and sometimes cookies) for papers. It was rough
                    and very time consuming for many projects which had some brute force tests for figuring out passwords.
                    One of the most important lessons I learned specifically from a brute force assignment was the significance of time
                    and the importance of code efficiecy (as I estimated that one of my algorithms would run from between many hours to many days).

                    In Highschool, we had a project known as the chariot races that we had to do every year for Latin class.
                    We had to work in groups on it but I decided to make my own without my partner because they
                    couldn't ever meet with me outside of class freshman year. Luckily for me, I didn't have to pull it for the races.
                    3 of my 4 years, I brought my chariot with small revisions done on it every year.
                    (We would race them across the parking lot to a line, and then run back. One rider, one puller)
                    If one wants to get the general idea of what the chariot races
                    looked like, <a src="https://www.facebook.com/marquettehigh/videos/2805540916139331/" target="_blank">click on this link here. </a>
