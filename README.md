This holds a new personal website about myself for the first assignment of CISC375.

It has four tabs - index.html, resume.html, projects.html, and resume.html

I used the fondation methods for divs

However, I couldn't figure out how to get the off-canvas to work.

I didn't fully customize pages and photos to look too great in this project.

I also creating my own styles for text in styles.css which is contained in the css folder

## index.html

Very simple home page.

It has links to the all 4 pages and shows that you are in this page.

It contains a photo of myself and I leave a small description of who I am.

## resume.html

I tried recreated my resume.docx file to the detail here.

However, I couldn't figure out how to indent text from the file.

I included links to the homepages of all the places I have studied since highschool and the places I have worked.

## projects.html

I share 4 projects that I have participated in here.

2 of the pictures that I use were taken by me. (The others were royalty free)

I explain a little about the projects that I was a part of in this webpage.

I link a video to a chariot races post made by my highschool here as well.

## fun.html

This was by far the most perplexing page.

I wasn't sure of what to do with it.

So I decided to write a little about my hobbies (games of various types), my family's pets, and my aspirations after graduation.

I used royalty free images for everything here because I don't have any photos of them.

This page is the most awkward due to the joycons photo that I downloaded being rediculously large.

## Mobile

While I tried to make it look good for mobile devices as well. It is a strech to say that it looks great for all of them. 

I feel like the text was somewhat hard to read because of how cobined it was.

## Photos

I downloaded multiple photos for this assignment but didn't use all of them.

Here were the one's that I placed in the folder:

* Team1732.jpg - a picture of our robot from 2018 being built.

* Self-Photo.jpg - a recent photo of myself on the boat tour

* Fish-Tank.jpg - a downloaded photo of a fishtank

* Chariot.jpg - my picture of the chariot I built in 2020.

* Beta-Testing.jpg - downloaded photo to say Beta-Testing for projects

* FIRST-Logo.png - the Logo of FIRST who held the robotics competetions globally

* Joy-cons.jfif - downloaded picture of joycons

* Bowling.jfif - downloaded picture of a bowling ball knocking down pins

* Mini-golf.jfif - downloaded picture of mini golf balls and putters

* Wii.jfif - downloaded picture of a wii

* Coding.jfif - downloaded picture of code
