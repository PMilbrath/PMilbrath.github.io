This holds a new personal website about myself for the first assignment of CISC375.

It has four tabs - index.html, resume.html, projects.html, and resume.html

I used the fondation methods for divs

However, I couldn't figure out how to get the off-canvas to work.

I didn't fully customize pages and photos to look too great in this project.

I also creating my own styles for text in styles.css which is contained in the css folder

## index.html

Very simple home page.

It has links to the all 4 pages and shows that you are in this page.

It contains a photo of myself and I leave a small description of who I am.

## resume.html

I tried recreated my resume.docx file to the detail here.

However, I couldn't figure out how to indent text from the file.

I included links to the homepages of all the places I have studied since highschool and the places I have worked.
